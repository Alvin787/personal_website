## ABOUT

I created this personal website to strengthen my ability with React. Next.js is a React framework with server side rendering and many other cool features. Chakra UI is a simple and modular component library I used to style this website. Framer Motion animation library is used for transistions and animation on the website. In order to create the 3D voxel model, I used MagicaVoxel to build it, then imported in Blender to export as .glb file format. To display the voxel I used a 3D library called Three.js to load the model accordingly.

## STACK: Next.js, Chakra UI, Three.js, Framer Motion
